    <br>
    <p> Hello world! I am a "Jack of All Trades" but Master of None...I'd like to say I'm a "Math Teacher", but really...there's so much more to me that just my day job</p>
    <p>I am always learning new stuff about technology, one of my ongoing passions!</p>
    <p>I am an avid "coder"; learning to code in C++, Ch (a variation of Objective-C), Python, HTML, and CSS</p>
    <p>I have a beautiful wife, Rebekah, and a gorgeous baby boy, Robby, and two puppies, Ricky (Maltipoo) and Lucy (Collie/Spaniel mix)</p>
